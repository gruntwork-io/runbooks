The Go server runs on port 7825 by default.

We use bun, so prefer that to npm.

We use https://taskfile.dev/ over makefiles. Look for the Taskfile.yml to see what command can you can run.

Docs are located in /docs 

The frontend is located in /web 

The backend is spread across /api, /browser, and /cmd. When the user requests something, make sure you know if they're asking to update the docs, frontend, or backend.

Whenever you plan to use Terraform examples, use OpenTofu instead.

## Error Reporting in MDX Components

The `useErrorReporting()` hook and `reportError()` function are for **configuration errors only** - problems with how the runbook MDX is written. These trigger the "This runbook has issues" banner.

**DO report** (configuration errors):
- Duplicate component IDs
- Missing required props
- Invalid prop values/combinations
- Malformed configurations

**DO NOT report** (runtime/operational errors):
- Authentication failures (bad credentials, expired tokens)
- Network errors during API calls
- AWS/cloud provider API errors
- User input validation failures during execution

Runtime errors should be displayed inline within the component (e.g., with an alert box) but should NOT call `reportError()`. The distinction: configuration errors are problems with the runbook itself; runtime errors are problems that occur when a user interacts with a correctly-configured runbook.

# Writing automated tests

Wherever possible, use the "source of truth" to recreate the program behavior, versus manually re-implementing the same logic in the test.
