title: Authoring workflow
---

If you're writing runbooks (not developing the Runbooks tool itself), use the following the workflow:

### 1. Create Your Runbook

Create a new `runbook.mdx` file:

```bash
mkdir my-runbook
cd my-runbook
touch runbook.mdx
```

### 2. Edit Your Runbook

Open `runbook.mdx` in your favorite editor and write your content using markdown and special blocks.

### 3. Open in Runbooks

```bash
runbooks open runbook.mdx
```

Your browser will open with the rendered runbook.

### 4. Iterate

Make changes to your runbook file and **refresh the browser** to see updates.

That's it! No build process or complicated setup.
