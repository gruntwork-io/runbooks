title: <GitClone>

The `<GitClone>` block provides a streamlined way to clone git repositories. It works with any git upstream, and includes optional GitHub integration for browsing organizations and repositories when a GitHub token is available.

### Basic Usage

At its simplest, the GitClone block provides a single text input for a git URL:

```mdx
<GitClone
  id="clone-repo"
  title="Clone Repository"
  description="Enter a git URL to clone"
/>
```

### With GitHub Authentication

When paired with a `<GitHubAuth>` block, the GitClone block enables a "Browse GitHub repositories" dropdown for discovering repos by organization and name. The GitHub token is also automatically injected when cloning GitHub URLs, enabling access to private repositories.

```mdx
<GitHubAuth
  id="gh-auth"
  title="Connect to GitHub"
  description="Authenticate to access private repos"
/>

<GitClone
  id="clone-repo"
  gitHubAuthId="gh-auth"
  title="Clone a Repo"
  description="Browse or enter a git URL to clone"
/>
```

### Pre-filled Values

You can pre-populate the URL, sparse checkout path, and local path fields. Users can still edit these values before cloning. This follows the same pattern as the `prefilledVariables` prop on the [Inputs](/authoring/blocks/inputs) block.

```mdx
<GitClone
  id="clone-docs"
  title="Clone Runbooks Docs"
  prefilledUrl="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/runbooks"
  prefilledRepoPath="docs"
  prefilledLocalPath="./runbooks-docs"
/>
```

### Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Yes | Unique block identifier. Used by downstream blocks to reference outputs. |
| `title` | `string` | No | Display title for the block header. Supports inline markdown. |
| `description` | `string` | No | Description text below the title. Supports inline markdown. |
| `gitHubAuthId` | `string` | No | Reference to a [`<GitHubAuth>`](/authoring/blocks/githubauth) block. When set, the block waits for authentication to complete and uses the token for GitHub API access and clone authentication. |
| `prefilledUrl` | `string` | No | Pre-fills the Git URL input field. The user can edit this value before cloning. |
| `prefilledRepoPath` | `string` | No | Pre-fills the sparse checkout path. When set, only the specified subdirectory of the repository will be cloned (e.g., `modules/vpc`). |
| `prefilledLocalPath` | `string` | No | Pre-fills the local path (relative to the current working directory) where files will be cloned. Defaults to the repository name if empty. |
| `usePty` | `boolean` | No | Whether to use a pseudo-terminal (PTY) for the git clone process. Defaults to `true`. PTY enables rich output like progress bars and colors. Set to `false` if your environment doesn't support PTY. |

### Accepted Git URL Formats

The GitClone block accepts the following URL formats:

| Format | Example | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| HTTPS | `https://github.com/org/repo.git` | Recommended. Token auth injected automatically for GitHub URLs. |
| HTTPS (no .git) | `https://github.com/org/repo` | Also works without the `.git` suffix. |
| Any host | `https://gitlab.com/org/repo.git` | Works with any git hosting provider. |
| SSH | `git@github.com:org/repo.git` | Token auth does **not** apply to SSH URLs. Use HTTPS for token-based auth. |

### GitHub Authentication

The GitClone block resolves GitHub credentials in the following order:

1. **`gitHubAuthId`** — If specified, uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` from the referenced GitHubAuth block's outputs.
2. **Session environment** — Checks the session environment for `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN`.
3. **No token** — The "Browse GitHub repositories" section is hidden. The user can still clone public repos or use SSH URLs.

When a GitHub token is available and the user enters a `github.com` HTTPS URL, the token is automatically injected on the server side for authentication. The token is never exposed in the browser.

### Sparse Checkout

Use the `prefilledRepoPath` prop (or the "Repo Path" input field) to clone only a specific subdirectory:

```mdx
<GitClone
  id="clone-vpc-module"
  title="Clone VPC Module"
  prefilledUrl="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-vpc"
  prefilledRepoPath="modules/vpc-app"
  prefilledLocalPath="./vpc-module"
/>
```

This uses `git sparse-checkout` under the hood, which is efficient even for large repositories because it only downloads the blobs for the specified path.

### Custom Local Path

The `prefilledLocalPath` prop (or the "Local Path" input field) controls where files are cloned, relative to the current working directory. If not set, the repository name is used.

### Block Outputs

After a successful clone, the GitClone block produces two outputs that can be referenced by downstream blocks:

| Output | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `CLONE_PATH` | Absolute path where files were cloned | `/Users/josh/Code/my-repo` |
| `FILE_COUNT` | Number of files downloaded (excluding `.git`) | `127` |

Reference outputs in downstream blocks using template variables:

```mdx
<Command
  id="list-files"
  title="List Cloned Files"
  command="ls -la {{ ._blocks.clone_repo.outputs.CLONE_PATH }}"
/>
```

<Aside type="note">
  Block IDs with hyphens are converted to underscores in template variables. For example, `clone-repo` becomes `clone_repo`.
</Aside>

### View Logs

The GitClone block includes a collapsible "View Logs" section (identical to the [Command](/authoring/blocks/command/) and [Check](/authoring/blocks/check/) blocks) that shows the full `git clone` output, including real-time streaming during the clone operation. This includes progress indicators, transfer statistics, and any error details.

### Example: Full Workflow

```mdx
<GitHubAuth
  id="gh-auth"
  title="Authenticate to GitHub"
/>

<GitClone
  id="clone-infra"
  gitHubAuthId="gh-auth"
  title="Clone Infrastructure Repo"
  description="Clone the infrastructure repository to make changes"
  prefilledUrl="https://github.com/acme-corp/infrastructure-live"
  prefilledLocalPath="./infra"
/>

<Command
  id="apply-changes"
  githubAuthId="gh-auth"
  title="Apply OpenTofu Changes"
  command="cd {{ ._blocks.clone_infra.outputs.CLONE_PATH }} && tofu apply -auto-approve"
/>
```
