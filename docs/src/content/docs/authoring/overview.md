# Authoring Runbooks

This section covers everything you need to know to write your own Runbooks.

## What's in a Runbook?

A Runbook combines **markdown documentation** with **interactive blocks** that can:

- Validate the user's current state with automated checks
- Execute shell commands and scripts
- Collect user input through forms
- Generate files from templates

All of this runs locally on the user's machine through a web interface.
