# runbooks open

This command is intended for **consumers** of Runbooks.

Use `runbooks open` to open a runbook in your browser and use it.

## Usage

```bash
runbooks open <source> [flags]
```

## Arguments

- `<source>` - A local path or remote URL pointing to a directory containing `runbook.mdx`, or to the file itself.

### Local paths

```bash
runbooks open ./path/to/runbook
runbooks open /absolute/path/to/runbook
runbooks open ./path/to/runbook.mdx
```

### Remote sources

You can open a runbook directly from a GitHub or GitLab URL without cloning the repo first:

```bash
# GitHub browser URL (copy/paste from your browser)
runbooks open https://github.com/org/repo/tree/main/runbooks/setup-vpc

# GitHub blob URL (pointing to the runbook.mdx file itself)
runbooks open https://github.com/org/repo/blob/main/runbooks/setup-vpc/runbook.mdx

# GitLab browser URL
runbooks open https://gitlab.com/org/repo/-/tree/main/runbooks/setup-vpc

# OpenTofu/Terraform module source format
runbooks open github.com/org/repo//runbooks/setup-vpc?ref=v1.0
runbooks open "git::https://github.com/org/repo.git//runbooks/setup-vpc?ref=main"
```

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| GitHub browser (dir) | `https://github.com/org/repo/tree/main/runbooks/setup-vpc` |
| GitHub browser (file) | `https://github.com/org/repo/blob/main/runbooks/setup-vpc/runbook.mdx` |
| GitLab browser (dir) | `https://gitlab.com/org/repo/-/tree/main/runbooks/setup-vpc` |
| GitLab browser (file) | `https://gitlab.com/org/repo/-/blob/main/runbooks/setup-vpc/runbook.mdx` |
| OpenTofu GitHub shorthand | `github.com/org/repo//path?ref=v1.0` |
| OpenTofu git::https | `git::https://host/org/repo.git//path?ref=main` |

<Aside type="note">
When opening a remote runbook, a temporary working directory is automatically used (equivalent to `--working-dir-tmp`). You can override this with `--working-dir` if needed.

### Authentication for private repos

For public repositories, no authentication is needed. For private repositories, set one of the following:

- **GitHub:** `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` environment variable, or run `gh auth login`
- **GitLab:** `GITLAB_TOKEN` environment variable, or run `glab auth login`

## Flags

- `--working-dir <path>` - Base directory for script execution and file generation (default: current directory)
  - All relative paths are resolved from this directory
  - Can be absolute or relative to current directory
- `--working-dir-tmp` - Use a temporary working directory (automatically cleaned up on exit)
  - Useful for isolated testing or sandboxed execution
  - Overrides `--working-dir` if both are specified
- `--output-path <path>` - Directory where generated files will be written (default: `generated`)
  - Resolved relative to the working directory
- `--no-telemetry` - Disable anonymous telemetry. Can also be set via `RUNBOOKS_TELEMETRY_DISABLE=1` environment variable.

## What it does

When you run `runbooks open`:

1. **Downloads (if remote)** - If given a remote URL, downloads just the runbook directory via sparse git clone
2. **Starts the Backend Server** - Launches a Go-based HTTP server on port 7825
3. **Launches the Browser** - Opens your default web browser to `http://localhost:7825`
4. **Serves the Frontend** - The web UI connects to the backend API to process the runbook
5. **Keeps Running** - The server continues running until you close the browser or press Ctrl+C

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use:**
If port 7825 is already in use, you'll see an error. Stop any other process using that port or modify the code to use a different port.

**Browser doesn't open:**
If the browser doesn't open automatically, you can manually navigate to `http://localhost:7825` after running the command.

**Browser window with the runbook doesn't open:**
Sometimes, your browser seems to launch, but you don't see the Runbook. The most likely issue here is that your browser launched with multiple tabs and windows and your Runbooks tab is not visible. Either look through all your browser windows, or go directly to http://localhost:7825.

**Runbook not found:**
Make sure the path points to a valid `runbook.mdx` file.

**Authentication errors for remote runbooks:**
If you see "authentication required", make sure you have set the appropriate token for the git host. See the Authentication section above.
