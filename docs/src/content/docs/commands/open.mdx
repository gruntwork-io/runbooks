# `runbooks open`

Opens a runbook in your default browser with the interactive web interface.

## Usage

```bash
runbooks open <path-to-runbook> [flags]
```

## Arguments

- `<path-to-runbook>` - Path to the `runbook.mdx` file.

<Aside type="note">
You must specify a path to the runbook _file_, not the _directory_ containing a runbook.
</Aside>

## Flags

- `--output-path <path>` - Directory where generated files will be written (default: `generated`)
  - Can be relative (e.g., `./output`) or absolute (e.g., `/tmp/generated`)
  - Relative paths are resolved from the current working directory

## When To Use It

Use `runbooks open` when you want to open a runbook in your browser and use it. This command is intended for consumers of Runbooks.

## What It Does

When you run `runbooks open`:

1. **Starts the Backend Server** - Launches a Go-based HTTP server on port 7825
2. **Launches the Browser** - Opens your default web browser to `http://localhost:7825`
3. **Serves the Frontend** - The web UI connects to the backend API to process the runbook
4. **Keeps Running** - The server continues running until you close the browser or press Ctrl+C

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use:**
If port 7825 is already in use, you'll see an error. Stop any other process using that port or modify the code to use a different port.

**Browser doesn't open:**
If the browser doesn't open automatically, you can manually navigate to `http://localhost:7825` after running the command.

**Browser window with the runbook doesn't open:**
Sometimes, your browser seems to launch, but you don't see the Runbook. The most likely issue here is that your browser launched with multiple tabs and windows and your Runbooks tab is not visible. Either look through all your browser windows, or go directly to http://localhost:7825.

**Runbook not found:**
Make sure the path points to a valid `runbook.mdx` file.
