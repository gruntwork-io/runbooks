The Runbooks CLI provides several commands for working with runbooks.

## Available Commands

### `open`
Opens a runbook in your default browser with the interactive web interface.

```bash
runbooks open <path-to-runbook>
```

<Aside type="note">
You must specify a path to the runbook _file_, not the _directory_ containing a runbook.
</Aside>

This is the primary command for using runbooks. It starts the backend server and launches the browser automatically.

### `serve`
Starts only the backend API server without opening the browser.

```bash
runbooks serve <path-to-runbook>
```

This is useful for development when you're running the frontend separately (e.g., with `bun dev`).

### `watch`
Continuously watches a runbook for changes and reloads automatically.

```bash
runbooks watch <path-to-runbook>
```

### `completion`
Generates shell completion scripts for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell.

```bash
runbooks completion <shell>
```

This is a hidden command (not shown in `--help` by default) but available for setting up shell auto-completion.

## Global Flags

- `--help` - Show help for any command
- `-h` - Short form of --help

## Default Port

The backend server runs on **port 7825** by default. This port is used both for the React frontend and for communication between the React frontend and the Go backend.
