The Runbooks CLI provides several commands for working with runbooks. All commands accept a local path or a remote URL as the runbook source.

- [`runbooks open`](/commands/open) — Open a runbook for consumers
- [`runbooks serve`](/commands/serve) — Start the backend server (for developers)
- [`runbooks watch`](/commands/watch) — Watch a runbook for changes (for authors)

### Remote URLs

Every command that accepts a `RUNBOOK_SOURCE` can open a runbook directly from a remote URL, removing the need to manually download any runbook files.

```bash
runbooks open https://github.com/org/repo/tree/main/runbooks/launch-rds
```

See [`runbooks open`](/commands/open/#remote-sources) for supported URL formats and authentication for private repos.
