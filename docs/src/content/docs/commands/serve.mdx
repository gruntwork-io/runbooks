# runbooks serve

Use `runbooks serve` to start the backend API server without starting the frontend server or opening the browser.

This command is intended for **developers** of the Runbooks tool itself.

## Usage

```bash
runbooks serve RUNBOOK_SOURCE [flags]
```

## Arguments

- `RUNBOOK_SOURCE` - A local path or remote URL pointing to a `runbook.mdx` file, the directory containing a `runbook.mdx` file, or an OpenTofu/Terraform module directory. See [runbooks open](/commands/open) for supported remote URL formats and OpenTofu/Terraform module auto-detection.

## Flags

- `--working-dir <path>` - Base directory for script execution and file generation (default: current directory)
  - All relative paths are resolved from this directory
  - Can be absolute or relative to current directory
  - Use `--working-dir=::tmp` for a temporary directory (automatically cleaned up on exit), useful for isolated testing or sandboxed execution
- `--output-path <path>` - Directory where generated files will be written (default: `generated`)
  - Resolved relative to the working directory
- `--tf-runbook <keyword-or-path>` - Select a built-in template or provide a custom runbook for OpenTofu/Terraform modules. See [runbooks open](/commands/open/#flags) for available templates.
- `--no-telemetry` - Disable anonymous telemetry. Can also be set via `RUNBOOKS_TELEMETRY_DISABLE=1` environment variable.

## What it does

When you run `runbooks serve`:

1. **Starts the Backend Server** - Launches a Go-based HTTP server on port 7825
2. **Serves the API** - Provides REST endpoints for the frontend to call
3. **Does NOT Open Browser** - You must manually navigate to `http://localhost:7825` or run the frontend separately

## Development workflow

Here's a typical development workflow:

1. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   runbooks serve testdata/demo-runbook
   ```

   Or if you want to easily re-compile the backend:

   ```bash
   go run main.go serve testdata/demo-runbook
   ```

2. In another terminal, start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd web
   bun dev
   ```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's port)

4. Make changes to:
   - React code in `/web/src` - hot reloads automatically
   - Go code - restart the `serve` command
   - Runbook files - refresh the browser
