# `runbooks serve`

Starts the backend API server without opening the browser. This command is useful for local development.

## Usage

```bash
runbooks serve <path-to-runbook> [flags]
```

## Arguments

- `<path-to-runbook>` - Path to the `runbook.mdx` file

<Aside type="note">
You must specify a path to the runbook _file_, not the _directory_ containing a runbook.
</Aside>

## Flags

- `--output-path <path>` - Directory where generated files will be written (default: `generated`)
  - Can be relative (e.g., `./output`) or absolute (e.g., `/tmp/generated`)
  - Relative paths are resolved from the current working directory

## When To Use It

Use `runbooks serve` when you want to start the backend API server without opening the browser. This command is intended for developers working on the Runbooks tool itself.

## What It Does

When you run `runbooks serve`:

1. **Starts the Backend Server** - Launches a Go-based HTTP server on port 7825
2. **Serves the API** - Provides REST endpoints for the frontend to call
3. **Does NOT Open Browser** - You must manually navigate to `http://localhost:7825` or run the frontend separately

## Technical Details

### Port
The server runs on **port 7825** by default (not currently configurable via flags).

### CORS
The server is configured to allow CORS requests from the Vite dev server during development.

### Frontend Assets
In production, the server serves the compiled React app from the `/web/dist` directory. During development, you typically run Vite separately on port 5173.

## Development Workflow

A typical development workflow:

1. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   runbooks serve ./testdata/demo-runbook-1/runbook.mdx
   ```

   Or if you want to easily re-compile the backend:

   ```bash
   go run main.go serve ./testdata/demo-runbook-1/runbook.mdx
   ```


2. In another terminal, start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd web
   bun dev
   ```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's port)

4. Make changes to:
   - React code in `/web/src` - hot reloads automatically
   - Go code - restart the `serve` command
   - Runbook files - refresh the browser
