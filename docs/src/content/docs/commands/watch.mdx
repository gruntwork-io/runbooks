# runbooks watch

This command is intended for **authors** of Runbooks.

Use `runbooks watch` to "watch" a `runbook.mdx` file (or its scripts, checks, or template files) for changes and automatically reload the Runbook as needed. 

<Aside type="caution">
When you update a `command` property, local template, or local script, the runbook will automatically load these changes in the _UI_, but because of the [executable registry](/security/execution-model/#executable-registry), the runbook will continue to execute the _old_ versions of these files. The solution is to always restart your runbook (re-run `runbooks watch`) when you make a template or script change.

## Usage

```bash
runbooks watch <path-to-runbook> [flags]
```

## Arguments

- `<path-to-runbook>` - Path to a directory containing the `runbook.mdx` file, or to the file itself.

## Flags

- `--disable-live-file-reload` - Enable executable registry validation. Scripts will not reload from disk when they are updated; instead, you must re-run the `runbooks` command to apply script changes. This trades lower convenience for higher security. See [Execution Security Model](/security/execution-model) for details.
- `--output-path <path>` - Directory where generated files will be written (default: `generated`)
  - Can be relative (e.g., `./output`) or absolute (e.g., `/tmp/generated`)
  - Relative paths are resolved from the current working directory
- `--no-telemetry` - Disable anonymous telemetry. Can also be set via `RUNBOOKS_TELEMETRY_DISABLE=1` environment variable.

## What It Does

When you run `runbooks watch`:

1. **Starts the Backend Server** - Launches a Go-based HTTP server on port 7825
2. **Opens Your Browser** - Automatically navigates to `http://localhost:7825`
3. **Watches for Changes** - Monitors the runbook file for any modifications
4. **Auto-Reloads** - Automatically refreshes the browser when changes are detected (within ~300ms)

### Writing a New Runbook

```bash
runbooks watch /path/to/runbook
```

Then in your editor:
1. Make changes to `runbook.mdx`
2. Save the file
3. See your changes instantly in the browser - no manual refresh needed!

## Technical Details

### File Watching
- Uses `fsnotify` for efficient file system monitoring
- Watches the directory containing your runbook file
- Implements debouncing (300ms) to handle editors that save files multiple times
- Only triggers on Write and Create events for your specific runbook file

### Auto-Reload Mechanism
- Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push notifications from server to browser
- The browser maintains a persistent connection to `/api/watch/sse`
- When the file changes, the server sends a `file-change` event
- The browser receives the event and automatically reloads the page
