## What are Runbooks?

Runbooks are **interactive markdown documents** that combine documentation with executable functionality. They allow you to:

- ✅ **Read** standard markdown content with rich formatting
- ✅ **Validate** system prerequisites with automated checks
- ✅ **Execute** shell commands with customizable parameters
- ✅ **Generate** code from templates using dynamic forms
- ✅ **Guide** users through complex procedures step-by-step

Think of runbooks as Jupyter Notebooks for DevOps and Infrastructure tasks.

## Quick Example

```mdx
# Deploy a New Service

## Prerequisites

<Check 
    id="check-kubectl" 
    command="kubectl version"
    title="Check if kubectl is installed"
    successMessage="kubectl is installed!"
    failMessage="Please install kubectl first"
/>

## Configuration

<Inputs id="service-config">
```yaml
variables:
  - name: ServiceName
    type: string
    description: Name for your service
  - name: Environment
    type: enum
    options: [dev, staging, production]
\```
</Inputs>

## Deploy

<Command 
    id="deploy" 
    command="kubectl apply -f {{ .ServiceName }}-{{ .Environment }}.yaml"
    inputsId="service-config"
    title="Deploy Service"
    successMessage="Service deployed successfully!"
/>
```

## Key Features

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Interactive Checks" icon="approve-check">
    Validate prerequisites and system state before proceeding. Checks run shell commands and show success/failure/warning based on exit codes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Commands" icon="rocket">
    Execute shell commands with variable substitution. Commands support Go template syntax and can reference user inputs from forms.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart Forms" icon="pencil">
    Generate dynamic web forms from Boilerplate templates. Support for strings, numbers, booleans, enums, lists, and structured maps.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Code Generation" icon="add-document">
    Generate infrastructure-as-code and configuration files from templates with user-provided variables using Gruntwork Boilerplate.

## Why Runbooks?

### The Problem

Traditional documentation becomes outdated quickly. Code examples don't work. Users struggle to adapt generic instructions to their specific situation. Knowledge transfer is difficult.

### The Solution

Runbooks ensure your documentation always works because it actually executes. Examples are tested every time they run. Instructions automatically adapt to user inputs. Expert knowledge is captured in an executable format.
