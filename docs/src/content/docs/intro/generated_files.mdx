When you use a Runbook, you'll often work with files, whether they're freshly generated from templates, or cloned from a git repository. The **files workspace** (labeled just "Files" in the Runbooks UI) is the panel on the right side of the Runbooks UI where all of these files live.

This page explains the two types of files you'll encounter, when each one appears, and how to work with them.

## Two types of files

The files workspace can show two categories of files, each in its own tab. Let's learn about each at a high level. Later, we'll dive into the details of each type of file.

### Generated files

| | |
|----------|-------------|
| **Where they come from** | [\<Template\>](/authoring/blocks/template/) or [\<Command\>](/authoring/blocks/command/) blocks generate them |
| **Where they're stored** | In a `generated/` folder on your local machine (by default) |
| **When you see them** | After you click "Generate" on a \<Template\> block<br />After a \<Command\> block writes to `$GENERATED_FILES` |
| **Git tracking** | Not tracked by git |

### Repository files

|||
|----------|-------------|
| **Where they come from** | Cloned from a git repository via a [\<GitClone\>](/authoring/blocks/gitclone/) block |
| **Where they're stored** | In a local path specified in the \<GitClone\> block |
| **When you see them** | After a \<GitClone\> block successfully clones a repository |
| **Git tracking** | Tracked by git |

<Aside type="tip">
If a runbook only produces generated files (no git clone), you'll only see the "Generated files" tab. If it only clones a repository, you'll only see the "Repository" tab. When both are present, you can switch between them using the context bar at the top of the workspace.
</Aside>

## Generated files

Generated files are new files that the runbook creates on your local machine. There are two ways they get created:

### Template blocks

The [Template](/authoring/blocks/template/) and [TemplateInline](/authoring/blocks/templateinline/) blocks generate files from [Boilerplate templates](/authoring/boilerplate/). When you fill in the form fields and click "Generate", the template engine processes your inputs and creates the output files.

```mdx
<Template id="vpc-setup" path="templates/vpc" />
```

Template blocks automatically re-render when you change input values, so your generated files stay in sync with the form.

### Command blocks with $GENERATED_FILES

[Command](/authoring/blocks/command/) blocks can write files to the `$GENERATED_FILES` environment variable to capture them:

```mdx
<Command
  id="export-terraform"
  command={`tofu output -json > "$GENERATED_FILES/tf-outputs.json"`}
  title="Export Terraform outputs"
/>
```

Any files written to `$GENERATED_FILES` automatically appear in the workspace after the command completes successfully.

### Where generated files are stored

Generated files are persisted to a folder on your local machine — they're not ephemeral or stored in memory.

By default, generated files are written to a `generated/` folder in the working directory (the directory you run the `runbooks` command from):

<FileTree>
- **generated/** &larr; Created in your working directory
  - main.tf
  - variables.tf
  - outputs.tf
</FileTree>

You can customize the output location with CLI flags:

```bash
# Use a specific working directory
runbooks open my-runbook --working-dir /path/to/project

# Write to a custom subfolder within the working directory
runbooks open my-runbook --output-path ./infrastructure

# Use an isolated temporary directory (auto-cleaned on exit)
runbooks open my-runbook --working-dir-tmp
```

<Aside type="tip">
The `--working-dir-tmp` flag is useful for sandboxed execution where you don't want generated files to persist after you close the runbook.
</Aside>

### Subdirectories within templates

If your template or script writes to a subdirectory of `$GENERATED_FILES`, the subdirectory will be created automatically. For example, if you write to `$GENERATED_FILES/config/app.json`, the `config/` subdirectory will be created automatically.

<FileTree>
- generated 
  - config/
    - app.json  
  - main.tf
  - variables.tf
  - outputs.tf
</FileTree>

```bash
# In a command script
mkdir -p "$GENERATED_FILES/config"
echo '{}' > "$GENERATED_FILES/config/app.json"
```

## Repository files

Repository files come from a git repository that was cloned by a [GitClone](/authoring/blocks/gitclone/) block in the runbook. When the clone completes, the workspace automatically switches to the **Repository** tab to show the cloned files.

The Repository tab has two sub-tabs:

### All files

The **All files** tab shows the complete file tree of the cloned repository. Click any file to view its contents with syntax highlighting.

### Changed files

The **Changed files** tab shows a diff view of any files that have been modified since the repository was cloned. This is useful when subsequent blocks in the runbook (like Command or Template blocks with `target="worktree"`) write files into the cloned repository. You'll see:

- Which files were added, modified, or deleted
- Line-by-line additions and deletions (similar to a GitHub pull request diff)
- A summary of total changes at the top

<Aside type="note">
The "Changed files" tab appears automatically the first time a change is detected. If no files have been modified, the tab will show zero changes.
</Aside>

### Multiple repositories

If a runbook clones more than one repository (using multiple GitClone blocks), a dropdown appears in the workspace header letting you switch between them.

## Security: Where files can be written

Runbooks enforces rules about where template-generated files can be written:

### Path restrictions

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Within working directory** | Output paths must resolve to locations within the working directory |
| **No directory traversal** | Output paths containing `..` (like `../../../etc/passwd`) are rejected |
| **No system directories** | Protected directories like `/etc`, `/usr`, `C:\Windows` are blocked |

<Aside type="note">
These restrictions apply to template output paths. Scripts executed via Command blocks have full filesystem access and can write anywhere the user has permissions.
</Aside>

### Protected directories

Runbooks blocks writes to system-critical directories:

- `/`, `/etc`, `/usr`, `/bin`, `/var`, `/home`, `/root`
- `C:\`, `C:\Windows`, `C:\Program Files`, `C:\Users`
