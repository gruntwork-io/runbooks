The quickest way to install Runbooks is to download the pre-built binaries from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/josh-padnick/runbooks).

<Aside type="note">
Runbooks binaries are not currently signed, so you will need to manually allow them. On macOS, you can do this by running:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/runbooks
```
</Aside>

### Installing from Source

You can also build the binaries yourself:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/josh-padnick/runbooks.git
   cd runbooks
   ```

2. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd web
   bun install
   bun run build
   ```

3. Build the binary:
   ```bash
   go build -o runbooks main.go
   ```

4. Move the binary to your PATH (optional):
   ```bash
   sudo mv runbooks /usr/local/bin/
   ```

5. Enable execute permissions for your binary
   ```bash
   chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/runbooks
   ```

6.. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   runbooks
   ```

### Verifying installation

Once installed, you can verify that `runbooks` is working by running:

```bash
runbooks version
```

## Next

Now that you have Runbooks installed, you can write your first runbook.
