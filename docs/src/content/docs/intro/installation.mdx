The quickest way to install Runbooks is to download the pre-built binaries from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/runbooks/releases).

### Installing pre-built binaries

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="macOS">
    **Using curl (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3/etc.):**
    ```bash
    # Download the latest release
    curl -Lo runbooks https://github.com/gruntwork-io/runbooks/releases/latest/download/runbooks_darwin_arm64

    # Make it executable
    chmod +x runbooks

    # Move to your PATH
    sudo mv runbooks /usr/local/bin/
    ```
    
    **Using curl (Intel Mac):**
    ```bash
    # Download the latest release
    curl -Lo runbooks https://github.com/gruntwork-io/runbooks/releases/latest/download/runbooks_darwin_amd64

    # Make it executable
    chmod +x runbooks

    # Move to your PATH
    sudo mv runbooks /usr/local/bin/
    ```

    <Aside type="tip">
      Not sure which chip you have? Run `uname -m` in your terminal. If it says `arm64`, you have Apple Silicon. If it says `x86_64`, you have an Intel Mac.
    </Aside>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Linux">
    **Using curl (x86_64/AMD64):**
    ```bash
    # Download the latest release
    curl -Lo runbooks https://github.com/gruntwork-io/runbooks/releases/latest/download/runbooks_linux_amd64

    # Make it executable
    chmod +x runbooks

    # Move to your PATH
    sudo mv runbooks /usr/local/bin/
    ```

    **Using curl (ARM64):**
    ```bash
    # Download the latest release
    curl -Lo runbooks https://github.com/gruntwork-io/runbooks/releases/latest/download/runbooks_linux_arm64

    # Make it executable
    chmod +x runbooks

    # Move to your PATH
    sudo mv runbooks /usr/local/bin/
    ```

    <Aside type="tip">
      Not sure which architecture you have? Run `uname -m` in your terminal. If it says `x86_64`, use the amd64 version. If it says `aarch64` or `arm64`, use the arm64 version.
    </Aside>

  <TabItem label="Windows">
    **Using PowerShell:**
    ```powershell
    # Download the latest release
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/gruntwork-io/runbooks/releases/latest/download/runbooks_windows_amd64.exe" -OutFile "runbooks.exe"

    # Move to a directory in your PATH (create if needed)
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\runbooks"
    Move-Item -Force runbooks.exe "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\runbooks\runbooks.exe"
    ```

    Then add `%LOCALAPPDATA%\runbooks` to your PATH:
    1. Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, and press Enter
    2. Go to the **Advanced** tab and click **Environment Variables**
    3. Under "User variables", select **Path** and click **Edit**
    4. Click **New** and add `%LOCALAPPDATA%\runbooks`
    5. Click **OK** to save

    <Aside type="tip">
      Alternatively, you can add to PATH via PowerShell (requires reopening your terminal):
      ```powershell
      [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";$env:LOCALAPPDATA\runbooks", "User")
      ```

### Building from source

As an alternative to downloading pre-built binaries, you can build the binaries yourself:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gruntwork-io/runbooks.git
   cd runbooks
   ```

2. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd web
   bun install
   bun run build
   ```

3. Build the binary:
   ```bash
   go build -o runbooks main.go
   ```

4. Move the binary to your PATH (optional):
   ```bash
   sudo mv runbooks /usr/local/bin/
   ```

5. Enable execute permissions for your binary
   ```bash
   chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/runbooks
   ```

6. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   runbooks
   ```

### Verifying installation

Once installed, you can verify that `runbooks` is working by running:

```bash
runbooks version
```
