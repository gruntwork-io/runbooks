## Meet Runbooks!

Runbooks are interactive markdown documents that enable subject matter experts to capture their knowledge and expertise in a way that is easy for others to understand and use.

Runbooks is [open source](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/runbooks) and free to use.

### What can Runbooks do?

Runbooks can:

- Render markdown text
- Generate one or more files based on user-entered values
- Run dynamically customized scripts
- Run dynamically customized "checks"
- Share user-entered values across more than one block within a runbook 

This collection of primitives is a powerful (and enjoyable) way to consume another person's expertise.

The Runbooks format is designed to be a straightforward authoring experience. Authors can use any text editor to write plain markdown along with a handful of powerful "blocks" (like `<Inputs>` and `<Template>`). Runbooks can be tested locally using the Runbooks CLI tool, offering a fast feedback loop for authors.

### How are Runbooks useful?

DevOps and Platform Engineers are often the "expertise bottlenecks" when it comes to enabling their organization to achieve an infrastructure goal.

Historically, there has not been a straightforward way to "capture" this hard-won expertise and make it available to others. And yet platform engineers are often the bottleneck for application engineers or others who depend on them to accomplish infrastructure goals.

In any situation where a "consumer" of expertise is blocked on the "producer" of expertise, Runbooks are an opportunity to free up the expert and empower consumers. 

Runbooks are especially useful for developer self-service, documenting internal processes or standard operating procedures, and codifying all the ways to use a given IaC pattern.

### What does a Runbook look like?

**Runbook authors** are DevOps subject matter experts and write Runbooks.

A typical Runbook directory looks like the file tree below. In this example, the file names are somewhat arbitrary, but the folder structure is conventional.

<FileTree >

- runbook.mdx The official Runbook file.
- checks/ Bash scripts used by [Checks](/authoring/blocks/check/)
  - preflight_checks.sh
- scripts/ Bash scripts used by [Commands](/authoring/blocks/command/)
  - install_mise.sh
- templates/ Templates used by [BoilerplateInputs](/authoring/blocks/boilerplateinputs)
  - consume_lambda_module
    - boilerplate.yml
    - terragrunt.hcl
- assets/ Images and other assets used by the Runbook
  - architecture.jpg

</FileTree>

You can learn more about how to write a Runbook in the [Authoring Runbooks](/authoring/overview) section, but for now, the basic idea is that a `runbook.mdx` file contains a mix of markdown and interactive [blocks](/authoring/blocks/). Those blocks optionally reference files in the `checks/`, `scripts/`, `templates/`, and `assets/` directories.

### How do you open a Runbook?

**Runbook consumers** want to apply someone else's DevOps expertise, so they consume Runbooks by opening them on their local machine, and using them in their web browser.

To open a Runbook, you can use the `runbooks open` command:

```bash
runbooks open /path/to/runbook.mdx
```

Note that for now, you will need to manually download the full Runbook directory (`runbook.mdx` plus any other files in the `checks/`, `scripts/`, and `templates/` directories) to your local machine.
