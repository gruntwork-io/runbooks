Runbooks are especially useful for several use cases. Let's discuss them!

## Developer Self-Service

Enable developers to perform complex operations without deep expertise:

- **Onboarding new projects**: Runbooks guide developers through setting up new services with all the right configurations
- **Infrastructure provisioning**: Generate and deploy infrastructure-as-code with validated inputs
- **Tool installation**: Check for prerequisites and guide installation of required tools

Example: A runbook that creates a new microservice with proper AWS infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring configuration.

## Streamlining Internal Processes

Document and automate repetitive operational procedures:

- **Environment setup**: Automated setup of development, staging, and production environments
- **New customer setup**: Automate the steps required to provision a new customer

Example: You create an AWS account factory runbook that creates a new AWS account, configures the account baseline and all networking configurations, and validates everything along the way.

## Documenting and testing Infrastructure-as-Code Modules

Make your IaC modules more accessible with interactive documentation:

- **Module usage examples**: Show how to use Terraform/OpenTofu modules with real, working examples
- **Configuration generation**: Let users fill out forms to generate properly configured module calls
- **Testing**: Include checks that validate the module works as expected

Example: A runbook that documents your VPC OpenTofu module, generates a customized configuration based on user inputs, and validates the VPC was created correctly.

## Automatically Updated Long-Form Guides

<Aside type="note">
Runbooks does not yet support automatically rendering static markdown files from generated code snippets, but this feature is coming soon!
</Aside>

Create markdown guides that stay current with your infrastructure:

- **Onboarding documentation**: Guides that actually work because they execute real commands
- **Troubleshooting guides**: Diagnostic runbooks that check system state and suggest fixes
- **Best practices**: Codified knowledge that can be executed, not just read

Example: A comprehensive AWS multi-account setup guide that creates accounts, configures IAM, sets up networking, and validates everything along the way.
