Let's create a simple runbook from scratch!

## Create the Runbook File

1. Create a new folder called `my-first-runbook`.
1. Inside that folder, create a file called `runbook.mdx`.
1. Create subfolders called `scripts` and `templates/project`.
1. Copy/paste the following content into each file:

You can also [download the complete example](/my-first-runbook.zip) as a zip file.

<SourceFile file="testdata/my-first-runbook/runbook.mdx" lang="mdx" />

<SourceFile file="testdata/my-first-runbook/scripts/setup.sh" lang="bash" />

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x my-first-runbook/scripts/setup.sh
```

<SourceFile file="testdata/my-first-runbook/templates/project/boilerplate.yml" lang="yaml" />

<SourceFile file="testdata/my-first-runbook/templates/project/README.md" lang="markdown" title="templates/project/README.md" />

<SourceFile file="testdata/my-first-runbook/templates/project/.gitignore" lang="text" title="templates/project/.gitignore" />

## Open Your Runbook

Save the files and open the runbook:

```bash
runbooks open my-first-runbook/runbook.mdx
```

Your browser will open showing the runbook interface. Follow the steps to execute each block!

## Understanding the Blocks

Here's a quick overview of what we used:

### `<Admonition>`

Callout boxes for important information:

```mdx
<Admonition type="info" title="Title" description="Description" />
```

Types: `info`, `warning`, `danger`, `success`. [Learn more](/authoring/blocks/admonition).

### `<Check>`

Runs a command and shows success/failure based on exit code:

```mdx
<Check id="my-check" command="git --version" title="Check Git" />
```

Exit 0 = success, exit 1 = failure, exit 2 = warning. [Learn more](/authoring/blocks/check).

### `<Template>`

Generates files from a template directory with its own form:

```mdx
<Template id="my-template" path="templates/my-template" />
```

The template directory must contain a `boilerplate.yml` that defines the form variables. [Learn more](/authoring/blocks/template).

### `<Command>`

Executes scripts with variable substitution. Use `inputsId` to pull variables from a `<Template>`:

```mdx
<Command id="run-script" path="scripts/setup.sh" inputsId="my-template" />
```

Or run inline commands:

```mdx
<Command id="hello" command="echo 'Hello World!'" />
```

If you've already installed `runbooks`, you'll see what the Runbook above looks like for end users. But if you're just browsing for now, let's show you what the end-user experience for the above Runbook looks like.
