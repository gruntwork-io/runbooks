Let's create a simple runbook from scratch!

## Create the runbook file

1. Create a new folder called `my-first-runbook`.
1. Inside that folder, create a file called `runbook.mdx`.
1. Create subfolders called `scripts` and `templates/project`.
1. Copy/paste the following content into each file:

You can also [download the complete example](/my-first-runbook.zip) as a zip file.

<SourceFile file="testdata/my-first-runbook/runbook.mdx" lang="mdx" title="runbook.mdx" />

<SourceFile file="testdata/my-first-runbook/scripts/setup.sh" lang="bash" title="scripts/setup.sh" />

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x my-first-runbook/scripts/setup.sh
```

<SourceFile file="testdata/my-first-runbook/templates/project/boilerplate.yml" lang="yaml" title="templates/project/boilerplate.yml" />

<SourceFile file="testdata/my-first-runbook/templates/project/README.md" lang="markdown" title="templates/project/README.md" />

<SourceFile file="testdata/my-first-runbook/templates/project/.gitignore" lang="text" title="templates/project/.gitignore" />

## Open your runbook

Save the files and open the runbook:

```bash
runbooks open my-first-runbook/
```

Your browser will open showing the runbook interface. Follow the steps to execute each block!

## Next

If you've already installed `runbooks`, you'll see what the Runbook above looks like for end users. But if you're just browsing for now, let's show you what the end-user experience for the above Runbook looks like.
