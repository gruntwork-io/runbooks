As an open source tool, Runbooks has some limitations. If you're looking for:

- A web-based way to browse your Runbooks
- A secure hosting environment for running Runbooks
- The ability to dynamically populate dropdowns based on data from your own environment (e.g. AWS accounts) or AWS (e.g. latest RDS engine versions)
- Centrally managed scripts you can distribute across your Runbooks
- Audit logs
- Guarantees around which Runbooks you can trust
- Security scanning for Runbooks
- First-class integration with your existing tools
- Something else that Runbooks open source doesn't support
