# Persistent Environment Model Demo

This runbook demonstrates the persistent execution environment model, where environment 
variable changes made in one block persist to subsequent blocks within the same session.

## Overview

In this demo, we'll:
1. Set environment variables in Block 1
2. Read those variables in Block 2 to prove persistence
3. Modify the variables in Block 3
4. Verify the modifications in Block 4
5. Change the working directory and verify persistence

## 1. Set Initial Environment Variables

Let's start by setting some environment variables. These will persist to all subsequent blocks.

<Command 
    id="set-initial-env"
    path="scripts/set-initial-env.sh"
    title="Set initial environment variables"
    description="This command exports DEMO_VAR, DEMO_COUNT, and DEMO_PROJECT. These will be available in all subsequent blocks."
    successMessage="Environment variables set successfully!"
    failMessage="Failed to set environment variables."
/>

---

## 2. Verify Environment Variables Persist

Now let's verify that the variables we set in Block 1 are available in this block.

<Check 
    id="verify-env-vars"
    path="checks/verify-env-vars.sh"
    title="Verify environment variables"
    description="This check reads the environment variables set in the previous block. If they're present, the persistent environment is working!"
    successMessage="Environment variables persisted successfully!"
    failMessage="Environment variables did not persist. The session may not be working correctly."
/>

---

## 3. Modify Environment Variables

Let's modify the environment variables to demonstrate that changes propagate forward.

<Command 
    id="modify-env"
    path="scripts/modify-env.sh"
    title="Modify environment variables"
    description="This command modifies DEMO_COUNT and adds a new DEMO_MODIFIED variable."
    successMessage="Environment variables modified!"
    failMessage="Failed to modify environment variables."
/>

---

## 4. Verify Modifications

Let's verify that the modifications from Block 3 are visible.

<Check 
    id="verify-modified-env"
    path="checks/verify-modified-env.sh"
    title="Verify modified environment"
    description="This check verifies that DEMO_COUNT was incremented and DEMO_MODIFIED exists."
    successMessage="Environment modifications persisted!"
    failMessage="Environment modifications did not persist."
/>

---

## 5. Change Working Directory

The persistent environment also tracks the working directory. Let's change it.

<Command 
    id="change-workdir"
    path="scripts/change-workdir.sh"
    title="Change working directory"
    description="This command changes to /tmp and exports a marker variable."
    successMessage="Working directory changed!"
    failMessage="Failed to change working directory."
/>

---

## 6. Verify Working Directory

Let's verify that the working directory change persisted.

<Check 
    id="verify-workdir"
    path="checks/verify-workdir.sh"
    title="Verify working directory"
    description="This check verifies we're now in /tmp."
    successMessage="Working directory persisted!"
    failMessage="Working directory did not persist."
/>

---

## Summary

If all checks passed, you've successfully demonstrated the persistent environment model:

- **Environment variables** set in one block are available in subsequent blocks
- **Modifications** to environment variables propagate forward
- **Working directory** changes persist across blocks

This is similar to how Jupyter notebooks maintain state across cells, enabling complex 
multi-step workflows where each step builds on the previous one.

### Re-execution Note

If you re-run Block 1 now, it will execute with the **current** environment state, 
not a historical snapshot. The environment will be reset to the initial values specified 
in that block.
