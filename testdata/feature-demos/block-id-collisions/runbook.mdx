# Block ID Collision Demo

This runbook demonstrates how Runbooks detects and reports block ID collisions.

## Why ID Collisions Matter

Block IDs must be unique because they're used to:
- Reference outputs from other blocks (e.g., `{{ ._blocks.my_command.outputs.result }}`)
- Track execution state
- Share data between blocks

Since Go templates interpret hyphens as subtraction, IDs like `create-account` are normalized to `create_account` for template access. This means `create-account` and `create_account` would collide.

## Example 1: Exact Duplicate IDs

These two Command blocks have the exact same ID. The second one will show a "Duplicate Component ID" error.

<Command id="my-command" path="scripts/hello.sh" args={["first"]} />

<Command id="my-command" path="scripts/hello.sh" args={["second"]} />

---

## Example 2: Normalized ID Collision

These two Command blocks have different IDs (`create-account` vs `create_account`), but they normalize to the same value for template access. The second one will show an "ID Collision" error.

<Command id="create-account" path="scripts/hello.sh" args={["hyphenated"]} />

<Command id="create_account" path="scripts/hello.sh" args={["underscored"]} />

---

## Valid: Different IDs

These blocks have truly different IDs and work fine:

<Command id="setup-dev" path="scripts/hello.sh" args={["dev"]} />

<Command id="setup-prod" path="scripts/hello.sh" args={["prod"]} />
