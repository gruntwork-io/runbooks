      # Note: Order matters! Blocks that produce outputs must run before
      # blocks that consume them via {{ ._blocks.x.outputs.y }}
      # All blocks below are commented out, so this test runs all blocks
      # in document order. Uncomment specific blocks to run only those.

      # - block: git-clone
      #   expect: success

      # - block: npm-demo
      #   expect: success

      # - block: color-demo
      #   expect: success

      # - block: progress-demo

    assertions:
      # TemplateInline blocks automatically validate their output dependencies.
