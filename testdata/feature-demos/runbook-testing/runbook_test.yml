      # blocks that consume them via {{ ._blocks.x.outputs.y }}
      # All blocks below are commented out, so this test runs all blocks
      # in document order. Uncomment specific blocks to run only those.

      # - block: check-git
      #   expect: success

      # - block: create-project

    assertions:
      # TemplateInline blocks automatically validate their output dependencies.
      # Add additional assertions to validate test results:
