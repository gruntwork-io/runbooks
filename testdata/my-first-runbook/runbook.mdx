# My First Runbook

Welcome to your first runbook! Let's walk through the key features of Runbooks.

## Full markdown support

The first thing to point out is that you have access to the _full set_ ~~of~~ **markdown capabilities** ❤️. Here are some commonly used elements, though almost all of [GitHub-Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) is supported:

| Element | Syntax | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Headings | `# H1` `## H2` `### H3` | Create section titles and hierarchy |
| Bold | `**text**` | Emphasize important text |
| Italic | `*text*` or `_text_` | Add subtle emphasis |
| Links | `[text](url)` | Create clickable hyperlinks |
| Images | `![alt](url)` | Embed images in your document |

### Admonitions

In addition to full markdown support, you can also include an [Admonition block](https://runbooks.gruntwork.io/authoring/blocks/admonition/) like this:

<Admonition type="info" title="Before You Begin" description="This is an Admonition block. Notice that it even supports _inline markdown_!" />

## Checks

When users are consuming a runbook, It can be helpful to "check" that they are prepared to succeed, or after using a runbook, that they did in fact succeed. This is the function of [Check blocks](https://runbooks.gruntwork.io/authoring/blocks/check/).

In this example, we're going to verify that git is installed:

<Check
    id="check-git"
    command="git --version"
    title="Check if Git is installed"
    description="We need Git for version control"
    successMessage="Git is installed!"
    failMessage="Git is not installed. Please install it from https://git-scm.com/"
/>

That was a pretty simple check, so now let's load our check from a script, and allow users to _customize_ that script on the fly.

<Check id="check-git-version" path="checks/check-git-version.sh" title="Check Git Version" description="Verify that you're running a specific version of git" failMessage="Hmm, your git version seems off. Try again." successMessage="Success! Well now, look who's got the expected git version.">
  <Inputs id="git-version-inputs">
    ```yaml
    variables:
      - name: GitVersion
        type: string
        description: "The exact git version you expect to have installed (e.g., 2.39.0)"
        validations:
        - required
        default: "2.39.0"
    ```
  </Inputs>
</Check>

If you look at the source code for this runbook, you'll see that we declare the inputs (or variables) we want, and Runbooks renders a web form automatically:

```yaml
variables:
- name: GitVersion
  type: string
  description: "The exact git version you expect to have installed (e.g., 2.39.0)"
  validations:
  - required
  default: "2.39.0"
```

We declare the variables using [Gruntwork Boilerplate syntax](#), and we have significant control over how the webform renders based on what the [Inputs block](https://runbooks.gruntwork.io/authoring/blocks/inputs/) supports.

## Generate files

Now let's generate some files. We're going to specify a Gruntwork Boilerplate template, that includes a declaration of the variables in that template, and the template files themselves. 

Runbooks will then render a web form automatically and generate the files for us!

<Template id="project" path="templates/project" />

<Admonition type="info" title="Templates update in real time" description="Try updating the author name and programming language, and notice how the rendered template changes in real time." />

On your local machine, all the newly generated files are available in a subfolder named `generated` folder, relative to where you ran `runbooks` from. You can customize where these files get generated by using the `runbooks --output-path` flag.

## Run commands

Runbooks also gives you the [Command block](https://runbooks.gruntwork.io/authoring/blocks/command/), which allows you to run arbitrary scripts.

You can even parameterize the scripts with a custom set of inputs, or any of the inputs we collected above.

<Command 
    id="run-setup"
    path="scripts/setup.sh"
    inputsId="project"
    title="Run Project Setup"
    description="Creates your project structure"
    successMessage="Project setup complete!"
    failMessage="Setup failed. Check the logs for details."
/>

Commands are useful when you need to do things like:

- Make an API call
- Install tools locally
- Run commands locally

Whereas Checks blocks are focused on _reading_ the current state of the world, Command blocks are focused on _mutating_ the state of the world.

## Congratulations!

<Command 
    id="final-message"
    command="echo '🎉 Congratulations! You finished using your first runbook!'"
    title="Show Success Message"
/>

**Great job!**

Everything above was built in nothing more than a text editor. I typed in some markdown and blocks (e.g. `<Check>` or `<Template>`), refreshed my browser, and verified that things looked the way I wanted. In fact, Runbooks offers `runbooks watch` specially for authors who want fast feedback loops.

You can also use AI to write Runbooks! Give your favorite LLM the [Runbooks LLM instructions](#), along with what you want, and you get a fast starting point.
