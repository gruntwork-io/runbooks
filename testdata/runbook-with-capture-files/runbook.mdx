# Test: Command File Capture

This runbook tests the `captureFiles` feature for Command components.

## Test 1: Basic File Capture

This command creates a file that should appear in the workspace.

<Command 
  id="create-file"
  title="Create a greeting file"
  description="This command writes a file to the workspace"
  command={`echo "Hello from the command!" > greeting.txt`}
  captureFiles
  successMessage="File created successfully!"
  failMessage="Failed to create file"
/>

## Test 2: File Capture with Output Path

This command creates files in a subdirectory of the workspace.

<Command 
  id="create-config"
  title="Create config files"
  description="This command writes files to a 'config' subdirectory"
  command={`mkdir -p subdir && echo '{"name": "test"}' > config.json && echo 'key=value' > subdir/settings.ini`}
  captureFiles
  captureFilesOutputPath="config"
  successMessage="Config files created!"
  failMessage="Failed to create config files"
/>

## Test 3: Regular Command (No Capture)

This command runs but does NOT capture files (default behavior).

<Command 
  id="no-capture"
  title="Run without capture"
  description="This is a regular command that doesn't capture files"
  command={`echo "This output goes to logs only"`}
  successMessage="Command completed!"
/>
