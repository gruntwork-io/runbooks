    steps:
      # Note: Order matters! Blocks that produce outputs must run before
      # blocks that consume them via {{ ._blocks.x.outputs.y }}
      # If no blocks are listed, the test runs all blocks in document order.

    assertions:
      # TemplateInline blocks automatically validate their output dependencies.
      # Add additional assertions to validate test results:
      # - type: file_exists
      #   path: generated/README.md
      # - type: file_contains
      #   path: generated/README.md
      #   contains: "expected content"

    # cleanup:
    #   - command: rm -rf /tmp/test-resources
    #   - path: cleanup/teardown.sh
