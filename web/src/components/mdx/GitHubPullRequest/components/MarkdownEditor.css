/* Restore markdown-body styles inside the PR description preview.
   The outer .runbook-block resets margins and list styles for form elements,
   but the preview pane needs them back for rendered markdown.
   Scoped here instead of App.css since only MarkdownEditor uses these.

   Selectors include .runbook-block to beat the specificity of the resets
   in App.css (which target .markdown-body .runbook-block <element>). */
